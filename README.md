# 7Speaking Bot Remastered

This is an English bot that allows you to perform 7Speaking exercises automatically, simulating a real user with appropriate waits and anti-bot detection mechanisms.

## Installation

To use this bot, you need to add the script to an extension called Tampermonkey.

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser.
2. Add the desired script to Tampermonkey.

## Available Versions

### `oldv1.js`

- **Description**: This is the old bot version.
- **Status**: Contains ugly code and is detected by 7Speaking.
- **Usage**: Not recommended.

### `v2 stable`

- **Description**: This is the stable version of the bot.
- **Status**: Recommended for use.
- **Usage**: Preferred version for reliable performance.

### `v2 -dev`

- **Description**: This is the development version of the bot.
- **Status**: Contains the latest updates but may not work properly.
- **Usage**: Use with caution, as it may have unstable features.

## Usage

1. Choose the version of the script you want to use.
2. Copy the script content.
3. Open Tampermonkey and create a new script.
4. Paste the copied script content into the new script.
5. Save and enable the script in Tampermonkey.

## V2 LOG:
The V2 add several things, like a new anti-bot bypass to be more undetectable. A rewrite from 0, so the code is more epurated and efficiency.
And the best in this V2, is the configuration option. The first line of the script is fully of variable that you can edit to make the script act in several ways.
Everythings is explained in the code as commentary.
The V2 officially support toefl except for hiddenmode 1 and 2. Trying it will make code crash

### Dev logs:
Quiz is now supported. It's only supporting Hiddenmode 1,2,3 and 4 (no automatic for now, mode 0).
HiddenMode 0 doesn't work and will maybe never work.

## Disclaimer

Use this bot at your own risk. The developers are not responsible for any consequences arising from the use of this bot.

### Maybe discontinued
I will stop this project when the actual dev version would be able to run in prod and will not go back on it until 7speaking patch it, and maybe more (in 2028, this project will be officially out of support)
